We're having our first meeting!

We all want to learn how to participate in the wider open source
community as well as possibly starting our own projects.

Thank you to Steve Price for organizing our first meeting at 
https://www.themakermovement.com.au[The Maker
Movement Cafe]

Steve is busy at the moment with our first attempt at an open source
contribution (https://github.com/up-for-grabs/up-for-grabs.net/issues/250)
So far he has managed to write a failing unit test. Yay!

Anyway thankyou for attending:

* Stephen Price
* Mohammad Zaatar
* Toby Potter
* Kieran Mesquita
* Nathan Szlichta
* David Hart (me)

During the meeting we have also managed to create a githubpages 
front page (https://perthhackers.github.io) and this blog.

Looking forward to the next time.
